# The original issue was about shed requiring two passes to format this:
# on first run autoflake would remove imports, and second run isort would collapse
# to a single line of imports.
# Now we have slightly different behaviour: black will add a trailing comma to the
# import list, which ruff then will respect when removing imports, such that it doesn't
# collapse the imports to a single line.
# If removing the trailing comma from the original import, we should be back to getting
# it collapsed - when we replace black with ruff, or run black after ruff.
